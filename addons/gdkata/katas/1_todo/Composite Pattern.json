{"method_name":"calculate_total_size","expected_type_hint":2,"name":"Composite Pattern","description":"Implement a file system using the composite pattern. Given a structure as nested arrays where strings are files (size = length) and arrays are folders, calculate the total size. Example: ['a.txt', ['subfolder', 'b.txt']] where folder size = sum of contents.","hints":"Recursively traverse the structure. Files (strings) return their length. Folders (arrays) return the sum of their children's sizes. The composite pattern treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.","language":"EN","difficulty":9,"arguments":[{"name":"structure","type_hint":28}],"tests":[{"expected":5,"name":"Single file","description":"['hello'] -> 5","arguments":[[["hello"]]]},{"expected":10,"name":"Multiple files","description":"['hello', 'world'] -> 10","arguments":[[["hello","world"]]]},{"expected":15,"name":"Nested folder","description":"['hello', ['folder', 'world', 'test!']] -> 15","arguments":[[["hello",["folder","world","test!"]]]]}]}
