# GDKata

A Godot 4.5+ Editor Plugin for practicing GDScript through coding katas.

## What is a Kata?

A kata is a small coding exercise designed to improve your programming skills through practice. Each kata presents a problem that you solve by implementing a GDScript function. Your solution is automatically tested against predefined test cases.

## Features

- **128+ Coding Challenges** - From basic algorithms to design patterns
- **Bilingual Support** - Katas available in German and English
- **Integrated Test Runner** - Immediate feedback on your solutions
- **Progress Tracking** - Track your completed katas locally
- **Difficulty Levels** - Challenges range from beginner to advanced

## Installation

**Not yet available in the AssetLib**

### Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `addons/gdkata` folder into your project's `addons` directory
3. Enable the plugin in **Project > Project Settings > Plugins**

## Usage

1. After enabling the plugin, you'll see a new **Kata** tab in the main editor
2. The **Kata Selector** dock (left side) shows all available katas
3. Select a kata and click **Start** to begin
4. Implement the required function in the generated script
5. Click **Run Tests** to check your solution
6. The **Results** dock (right side) shows test outcomes

## Kata Categories

### Basic Algorithms
- String manipulation (reverse, count vowels, palindrome check)
- Array operations (sum, filter, find maximum)
- Math functions (factorial, fibonacci, prime check)

### Intermediate
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search algorithms (Binary Search, Dijkstra)
- Data structures (LRU Cache)

### Design Patterns
- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- Structural: Composite, Decorator
- Behavioral: Observer, Strategy, Command, State Machine, and more

## Creating Custom Katas

You can create your own katas using the `KataGenerator.tres` resource:

1. Open `addons/gdkata/katas/KataGenerator.tres`
2. Fill in the kata details:
   - `method_name`: Function name to implement
   - `name`: Display name of the kata
   - `description`: Instructions for the user
   - `arguments`: Input parameters with types
   - `tests`: Test cases with expected outputs
3. Click **Generate JSON** to create the kata file

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
- Add new katas
- Improve existing kata descriptions
- Fix bugs
- Translate katas to other languages

## DISCLAIMER

The initial Proof of Concept was 100% implemented by me. I used AI for the following things:

- Refactoring of the testrunner (previously it was a scene that you had to start, as doing Katas this way felt clunky, I wanted to change that to a testrunner that's also a @tool-script)
- i18n inside the editor. Godot uses different translation mechanisms whether it's in editor or in runtime context. After fiddling around for more time than I was willing to spend, I told AI to do it (`./addons/gdkata/core/gdkata_tr.gd` - if anyone is interested)
- Minor improvements of UI/UX
- **Content**! Almost every single Kata was generated by AI and I actually think that it's a nice use case to let AI generate further Katas that you have to solve as you probably already know the solution if you'd need to write Katas for yourself that you solve afterwards. **This also means:** I haven't tested every Kata! Feel free to correct it or throw it away and write your own :)

_I know, using AI for code generation has its drawbacks, but this addon just serves the purpose to learn GDScript. I'd personally not be able to invest 2 weeks or more into this project to polish and improve everything by myself. I also did review the code and I consider it "fine enough" for the purpose of the addon, but feel free to replace the sloppy parts with something more maintainable and/or cleaner code._
